# ParticleWorkshop

ParticleWorkshop is bukkit plugin which replaces Chimneys SMP. It has much more features than Chimneys, for example support for all particles, playing particles only under water, playing particles relatively to an entity or block.
It also supports quota system, so each player has limited amount of particles depending on how hard it is for server to handle them. This is of course configurable.
It's currently in unstable state, but you can use this plugin on production server(s) at your own risk. No support will be provided until the plugin is released on BukkitDev.
